# Python - Week 01 - ASSIGNMENT

# 1: I'll be 20 in?

Use a variable to store your age, then use that variable to calculate how old
you will be in 20 years. Save that to a variable and output to the screen

`"I will be {age_in_20_years}"`

(replace `{age_in_20_years}` with the value of the variable you made earlier)

# 2: Counting Combatants

If there are 3 buildings with 25 ninjas hiding on each roof and
2 tunnels with 40 samurai hiding inside each tunnel, how many ninjas and samurai are about to do battle?
